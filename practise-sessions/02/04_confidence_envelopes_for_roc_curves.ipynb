    "A ROC curve $\\mathrm{Roc}:[0,1]\\to[0,1]$ packs a lot of information about a classifer. \n",
    "In particular, it allows to choose good trade-off points between recall and precision, or compare the performance of different classifiers.\n",
    "Note that we cannot compute the true ROC curve as it is determined by the exact data distributions of positive and negative classes.\n",
    "Instead we can only compute the approximation on a test set and thus the graph is bound to fluctuate.\n",
