## Home exercises

### Concepts to learn:

* Notions related to statistical test
  * Null hypothesis as a boring baseline
  * P-value assignment as a measure of bad luck
  * P-value assignment for one- and two-sided tests
  * Significance and confidence levels
  * Power as the ability to detect interesting events
  * Multiple testing and p-value corrections
* Confidence intervals and confidence envelopes
* Confidence envelopes for QQ-plots and ROC curves
* Permutation tests as a way to define baseline success
* Binomial and multinomial distributions
* Bayes formula and belief update procedure
* Internal and external consistency of belief updates
* Beta distribution as posterior of coin bias
* Dirichlet distribution as a posterior of dice parameters
* Laplace smoothing and pseudo-observations
* Conjugate priors as a loophole for fast inference
