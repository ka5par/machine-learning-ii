    "This measures the difference between model performance measures an is much more precise than the difference of absolute errors provided that we have large number of unlabelled data.\n",

    "If we consider the accuracy then the maximal possible difference between the models is the fraction of unlabelled samples $p$ on which the predictions differ. If a performance measure is additive and each datapoint can have a limited impact on the final score, the maximal difference between scores is proportional to $p$. Most measures satisfy this requirement. "
